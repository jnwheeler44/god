==============================================

* Authors: Tom Preston-Werner, Kevin Clark, Eric Lindval

Description
-----------

God is an easy to configure, easy to extend monitoring framework written in
Ruby.

Keeping your server processes and tasks running should be a simple part of
your deployment process. God aims to be the simplest, most powerful monitoring
application available.

This branch of God uses ActiveSupport in place of the Numeric Sugar, so
bytes are the default memory measurement.
